# microservice-eventBus-docker-kubernetes
Demo microservice react-nodejs application with a self managed basic event bus.
it's only for learning purposes, a production-grade microservice application will have a well-managed event bus like Kafka or rabbitmq. I've used Docker to build images of different microservices and used Kubernetes to manage the containers built from those images.
